        "comment": "It is a powerful tool for identifying and cracking password hashes. Here, I detected hash types, performs dictionary and brute-force attacks, and cracks protected ZIP files and NTLM hashes. Using wordlists, rules, and incremental modes, we can efficiently tests password security.",
